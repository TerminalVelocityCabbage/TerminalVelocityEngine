# Terminal Velocity Engine 2

The goal of the Terminal Velocity engine (TVE) is to provide barebones tools for all aspects of game development. 

### Tools include but are not limited to:
- Rendering
- Configurations
- Command Parsing
- Networking
- Debugging and Logging tools

A detailed wiki is planned for the future of the project, but currently the best way to keep track of the project's progress is on the Example repositories:
- Client: [TVE-ExampleClient](https://github.com/TerminalVelocityCabbage/TVE-ExampleClient)
- Server: [TVE-ExampleServer](https://github.com/TerminalVelocityCabbage/TVE-ExampleServer)
